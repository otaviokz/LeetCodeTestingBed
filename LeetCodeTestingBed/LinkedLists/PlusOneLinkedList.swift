/*
 Given a non-negative integer represented as a linked list of digits, plus one to the integer.
 
 The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: head = [1,2,3]
 Output:       [1,2,4]
 
 Example 2:
 
 Input: head = [0]
 Output: [1]
 
 Example 3:
 
 Input: head = [1,2,3,4,9]
 Output:       [1,2,3,5,0]
 
 Constraints:
 
 The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [1, 100].
 0 <= Node.val <= 9
 The number represented by the linked list does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
